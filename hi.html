            <p>In the short-term, sentiments influence the market more than other factors. Now, sentiments are positive globally as well as in India. The sentimental support from the mother market is strong since S&P 500 is at record high at 4850. Domestically the Pran Prathishta at Ayodhya has turned out to be a historic mega event boosting national sentiments substantially. These positives augur well for the market in the short run. Q3 results will impact specific stocks both positively and negatively. ICICI Bankâ€™s numbers are excellent, beating the street. With ICICI Bank ticking all the right boxes in credit growth, net profit growth and asset quality, the stock is set to lead the rally in large caps.Investors should also remember that sentimental impact cannot last long. Tensions in West Asia and the Red Sea are areas of serious concern. 
If something goes wrong, the market will be impacted since valuations are high. 
Therefore, even when optimistic, investors should be cautious.</p>

            <p>Medi Assist Healthcare Services made a strong debut in the secondary market at Rs. 460, with a listing premium of around 11% over its issue price of Rs 418.
This impressive performance followed an oversubscribed IPO by 16.25 times, further adding to the positive sentiment surrounding the health-tech firm's prospects.
Medi Assist Healthcare Services Limited is a well-established health-tech and insurance-tech company, but the identified concerns regarding client 
concentration and dependence on subsidiaries still require ongoing monitoring.</p>
